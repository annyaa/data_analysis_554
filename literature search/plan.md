# Literature search for CDKN2a

## Implementation

- Search PubMed and Europe PNC for CDK2Na and ARF
- Use MCP servers for both resources
- Create a markdown file called RESULTS.md with one paragraph per paper which contains:
    - Paper title
    - link to the resource
    - A short description of contents
    - DOI
- For each paper validate it to make sure that the link actually points to the correct paper etc
