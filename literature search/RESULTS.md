## Paper 1

**Title:** The INK4-ARF (CDKN2A/B) locus in hematopoiesis and BCR-ABL-induced leukemias

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19028987/)

**DOI:** [10.1101/sqb.2008.73.039](https://doi.org/10.1101/sqb.2008.73.039)

**Description:** This review by Williams and Sherr examines the INK4-ARF locus, which encodes the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and the tumour suppressor p14ARF. The paper documents that deletions at this locus occur frequently in aggressive Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) but rarely in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and demonstrates experimentally that loss of ARF function enhances drug resistance and increases leukaemia-initiating cell capacity in BCR-ABL-driven disease models.

## Paper 2

**Title:** Cdkn2a (Arf) loss drives NF1-associated atypical neurofibroma and malignant transformation

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31091306/)

**DOI:** [10.1093/hmg/ddz095](https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddz095)

**Description:** This study demonstrates that Arf (encoded by Cdkn2a) acts as a critical gatekeeper tumour suppressor in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), preventing progression of plexiform neurofibromas to malignancy. Conditional ablation of both Nf1 and Arf in the neural crest-derived Schwann cell lineage allowed cells to escape senescence-mediated growth arrest, producing tumours in mice that closely resemble human atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biological potential (ANNUBP) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs).

**Title:** The Yin and Yang-Like Clinical Implications of the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B Gene Cluster in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33435487/)

**DOI:** [10.3390/genes12010079](https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12010079)

**Description:** This review comprehensively analyses the 9p21.3 chromosomal cluster harbouring CDKN2A, ARF, and CDKN2B, describing how deletions at this locus represent one of the most frequent oncogenic events across ALL subtypes. The paper discusses the dual role of these deletions—improving certain prognostic markers while worsening overall outcomes—and evaluates their frequencies across paediatric and adult ALL cohorts, highlighting the cluster's potential as a therapeutic target.

## Paper 4

**Title:** High Positive Correlations between ANRIL and p16-CDKN2A/p15-CDKN2B/p14-ARF Gene Cluster Overexpression in Multi-Tumor Types Suggest Deregulated Activation of an ANRIL-ARF Bidirectional Promoter

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438464/)

**DOI:** [10.3390/ncrna5030044](https://doi.org/10.3390/ncrna5030044)

**Description:** Drak Alsibai et al. report significant positive correlations between expression of the long non-coding RNA ANRIL and the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B gene cluster across 17 cancer types. The strongest association was found with p14-ARF, suggesting that the ANRIL-ARF bidirectional promoter undergoes coordinated deregulated activation in cancer, a finding with implications for understanding non-coding RNA regulation of key tumour suppressors.

**Title:** Genetic and methylation status of CDKN2A (p14ARF/p16INK4A) and TP53 genes in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34826422/)

**DOI:** [10.1016/j.humpath.2021.11.008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2021.11.008)

**Description:** Chantre-Justino and colleagues investigate the somatic mutational and DNA methylation landscape of CDKN2A (covering both the p14ARF and p16INK4A transcripts) and TP53 in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) lesions. Strikingly, p14ARF promoter hypermethylation was detected in all cases examined, indicating that epigenetic silencing rather than mutational inactivation is the predominant mechanism of CDKN2A/ARF inactivation in this HPV-associated disease.

## Paper 6

**Title:** MLL3 regulates the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus in liver cancer

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37261974/)

**DOI:** [10.7554/eLife.80854](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80854)

**Description:** Zhu, Soto-Feliciano, Morris and colleagues at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center show that the histone methyltransferase MLL3 (KMT2C) co-activates the Cdkn2a locus via H3K4 methylation. Disruption of Kmt2c cooperates with Myc overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, and restoration of MLL3 function triggers Ink4a/Arf-dependent apoptosis, establishing MLL3 as an upstream epigenetic regulator of the CDKN2A tumour suppressor programme in liver cancer.

## Paper 7

**Title:** Melanoma genetics: an update with focus on the CDKN2A(p16)/ARF tumor suppressors

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10775844/)

**DOI:** [10.1067/mjd.2000.104687](https://doi.org/10.1067/mjd.2000.104687)

**Description:** This seminal review provides a historical and mechanistic overview of melanoma genetics, with particular focus on the dual-function CDKN2A locus. The paper explains how deletions at the p16/ARF locus simultaneously disable two distinct tumour suppressor pathways—the p16INK4a–RB pathway controlling G1 cell cycle entry, and the p14ARF–MDM2–p53 pathway regulating apoptosis—making this locus uniquely potent as a melanoma predisposition and somatic driver gene.

## Paper 8

**Title:** Transformation of primary murine peritoneal mast cells by constitutive KIT activation is accompanied by loss of Cdkn2a/Arf expression

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37063827/)

**DOI:** [10.3389/fimmu.2023.1154416](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1154416)

**Description:** This study characterises a transformed murine mast cell line (PMC-306) generated by constitutive KIT oncogenic signalling, and demonstrates that transformation is accompanied by complete loss of Cdkn2a and Arf expression. The findings establish a mechanistic link between sustained KIT pathway activation and suppression of these key cell cycle regulators, providing a model system for studying mast cell malignancy and the role of CDKN2A/ARF in mast cell tumour suppression.

## Paper 9

**Title:** Wnt9a Promotes Renal Fibrosis by Accelerating Cellular Senescence in Tubular Epithelial Cells

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440280/)

**DOI:** [10.1681/ASN.2017050574](https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2017050574)

**Description:** This paper investigates the role of Wnt9a in driving tubular cell senescence and subsequent renal fibrosis, showing that Wnt9a upregulates p16INK4A (encoded by CDKN2A) to induce senescence. Knockdown of p16INK4A inhibited the fibrotic programme, and the authors identified a reciprocal activation loop between senescent tubular cells and activated fibroblasts, positioning CDKN2A/p16INK4A as a mediator of Wnt-driven chronic kidney disease pathology.

**Title:** CDKN2A (p14ARF/p16INK4a) and ATM promoter methylation in patients with impalpable breast lesions

**Link:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26255234/)

**DOI:** [10.1016/j.humpath.2015.06.016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2015.06.016)

**Description:** This study analyses promoter methylation patterns of CDKN2A (including both p14ARF and p16INK4a transcripts) and ATM in impalpable breast lesions, comparing benign and malignant samples. The authors found variable methylation across CDKN2A components, with ATM showing the greatest degree of hypermethylation in malignant lesions, while CDKN2A methylation distinguished benign from pre-malignant lesions, supporting its utility as an epigenetic biomarker in early breast cancer detection.

**Title:** Frequency and clinical impact of CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B gene deletions as assessed by in-depth genetic analyses in adult T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

**Link:** [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30041662) | [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30041662/)

**DOI:** [10.1186/s13045-018-0639-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13045-018-0639-8)

**Description:** Genescà, Lazarenkov, Morgades and colleagues performed comprehensive genetic characterisation of CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B deletions in a cohort of adult T-ALL patients, detecting alterations in 55% of cases (35/64 patients). The study links specific deletion patterns to minimal residual disease clearance and overall prognosis, providing a detailed framework for understanding how 9p21.3 lesions shape treatment response and outcome in adult T-ALL.

## Paper 12

**Title:** Abnormal nuclear and nucleolar immunoreactivity of p16INK4a represents a frameshift alteration in CDKN2A: the E6H4 clone recognizes the 'p14ARF::p16INK4a' chimeric protein

**Link:** [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/41339993) | [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41339993/)

**DOI:** [10.1007/s00428-025-04365-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-025-04365-2)

**Description:** Mitsui, Kashima and colleagues describe a mechanistic explanation for aberrant p16INK4a immunostaining patterns in diagnostic pathology. Frameshift mutations within exon 2 of CDKN2A can simultaneously inactivate p16INK4a and shift the reading frame of the 3' p14ARF sequence into the p16INK4a open reading frame, producing a chimeric p14ARF::p16INK4a protein recognised by the E6H4 antibody clone and resulting in abnormal nuclear and nucleolar localisation.

**Title:** Dysregulated expression of the tumor suppressor p14ARF in cancer provides an effective target for TCR-T cell therapeutics

**Link:** [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/41638872) | [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41638872/)

**DOI:** [10.1136/jitc-2025-013520](https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2025-013520)

**Description:** Schmitt, Furiya, Black and colleagues identify a well-presented HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitope derived from p14ARF that is consistently detectable in the immunopeptidome of cancer biopsies. The study demonstrates that T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells targeting this p14ARF epitope can effectively kill cancer cells exploiting the aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation of p14ARF in tumours, providing a rationale for p14ARF-directed TCR-T cell immunotherapy.

**Title:** Somatic CRISPR tumorigenesis and multiomic analysis reveal a pentose phosphate pathway disruption vulnerability in MPNSTs

**Link:** [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/40802750) | [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40802750/)

**DOI:** [10.1126/sciadv.adu2906](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu2906)

**Description:** McGivney, Brockman, Borcherding and colleagues used somatic CRISPR-based tumorigenesis to model malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) and performed multiomic profiling to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. They found that CDKN2A-deleted MPNSTs are particularly dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway and NADPH metabolism, revealing a metabolic vulnerability linked to CDKN2A loss that could be exploited therapeutically.

## Paper 16

**Title:** AURKA promotes malignant properties of neuroblastoma and is downregulated by the PP2A pathway

**Link:** [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR1059862) | [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.29.665837)

**DOI:** [10.1101/2025.07.29.665837](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.29.665837)

**Description:** Stadler, Dahlhaus, Speleman and colleagues investigate the oncogenic role of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in neuroblastoma, finding that AURKA promotes malignant transformation specifically in the context of MYCN overexpression and INK4A/ARF depletion (CDKN2A loss). The study shows that AURKA expression correlates with poor prognosis and disease progression, and that PP2A pathway components negatively regulate AURKA protein levels, identifying a signalling axis with therapeutic relevance in CDKN2A-deficient neuroblastoma.
